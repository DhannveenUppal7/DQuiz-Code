## Inspiration
Hello Guys I am Dhannveen Uppal, a 13 year old programmer. During the online days of schooling
we often had quizzes over platforms such as Kahoot, Quizz, Bluekit, etc. This project tries to create
a community for the students which will help them to ace their exams and school life.          

## What it does
DQuiz is a STEM based Quiz Website, it is aimed to help people prepare for their exams, the purpose of the website is to create a community of students, one can also publish quizzes on the website to help others. Our Platform supports students and offers three subjects: Mathematics, Science and Technology. With an immersive experience students will love studying with our platform.
One of the biggest features of the website is that it also allows Visually Imparied people to learn and practice, DQuiz can read out the questions and the options for the users incase the person has any problem in understanding.
DQuiz also provides certification for each and every quiz, the only criteria is that you must score more than 50% in the quiz.
